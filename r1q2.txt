R1Q2 Source Code
================
Hello!
I ask that if you copy any code into your own engine
that you please credit me and include a link to the
R1Q2 homepage. Where possible, please be specific
about which features you have used from R1Q2.

If you fork R1Q2 in any way please modify the build
string to clearly indicate that it is a fork. I would
appreciate notification before you release any public
forks of R1Q2 so I can check them out. Thanks.

Rich.
